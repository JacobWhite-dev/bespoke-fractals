### Overview
Bespoke fractals are based on the work done on Chaotic Sensing (ChaoS) available at https://shakes76.github.io/ChaoS/. In this work, a fractal sampling pattern is proposed for use in MR in order to accelerate acquisition time. At the time of publishing of this work, only one fractal was known. The code in this repository extends on this work, providing tools for generating a wide array of fractal sampling patterns.
