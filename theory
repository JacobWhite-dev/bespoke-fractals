Fractal observed is an overlay of the original set of Farey vectors scaled by a real constant. This scaling in space results in scaling in frequency that in turn results in aliasing, generating the repeated patterns observed in each frame. Laying these frames on top of each other, each with some repeated version of the pattern, results in the fractal pattern. The significance of the Farey vectors is only that they do not overlap when scaled. Otherwise, the same effect can be achieved with any pattern.
